1) Numerical Variable:
=====================
    Definition:   A numerical variable, also known as a quantitative variable, represents data that can 
    be measured and expressed as numbers.
    Types:  
      1.1) Discrete Variables: 
      =======================
        Definition:   These are countable variables that have distinct, separate values.
        Example:   The number of siblings someone has (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
      1.2) Continuous Variables:
      =========================
        Definition:   These variables can take any value within a range, including fractions and decimals.
        Example:   Height (e.g., 170 cm, 170.5 cm, 170.55 cm).

      2) Categorical Variables: 
      =========================
    Definition:   Variables that represent data divided into groups or categories.
    Example:   Favorite fruit (e.g., Apple, Banana, Orange).

      3) Ordinal Variables: 
      =======================
    Definition:   A type of categorical variable where the categories have a meaningful order or ranking, 
    but the differences between them aren’t necessarily consistent.
    Example:   Education level (e.g., High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD).

      4) Interval Variables:
      ======================
    Definition:   Numerical variables where the intervals between values are meaningful and consistent, 
    but there is no true zero point.
    Example:   Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit (e.g., 0°C does not mean the absence of temperature).

      5) Ratio Variables: 
      ===================
    Definition:   Numerical variables that have a meaningful zero point, meaning zero represents the absence 
    of the variable, and both the intervals and ratios between values are meaningful.
    Example:   Weight (e.g., 0 kg means no weight).

      6) Dichotomous Variables:
      ========================
    Definition:   Categorical variables that have only two possible outcomes.
    Example:   Yes/No responses (e.g., diabetic or not).

      Statistics: 
      ===========
    Definition:   The science of collecting, analyzing, presenting, and interpreting data.
    Types:  
      1) Descriptive Statistics:
      ==========================
      
        Definition:
	Statistics that summarize and describe the features of a dataset.
        Types:  
          1.1) Measures of Central Tendency:  
	  ==================================
            Definition:
	    Values that describe the center of a dataset.
            Examples:   Mean, Median, Mode.
	    Deviation: 
	    =========
	    Mean Deviation:
	    ===============
	    Covarient of Coefficient:
	    ==========================
          1.2) Measures of Dispersion: 
	  ==========================
            Definition:   Values that describe the spread of the data.
            Examples:   Standard Deviation, Variance, Range.
          1.3) Measures of Position:  
	  ==========================
            Definition:   Values that describe the relative position of data points in a dataset.
            Examples:   Percentiles, Quartiles.
          1.4) Other Measures:  
	  ====================
            Examples:   Frequency Distribution, Skewness (measure of asymmetry), Kurtosis (measure of the 
	    peakedness of a distribution), Normal Distribution, Poisson Distribution, Binomial Distribution.
      2) Inferential Statistics: 
      ==========================
        Definition:   Statistics that make inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample 
	of data.
        Types:  
          2.1) Estimation: 
	  ================
            Definition:   The process of inferring the value of a population parameter based on a sample 
	    statistic.
            Examples:   Point estimation, Interval estimation.
          2.2) Hypothesis Testing:  
	  ========================
            Definition:   A method used to decide whether there is enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis 
	    in favor of an alternative hypothesis.
            Examples:   P value, Significance Level, Statistical Tests.
          2.3) Regression:  
	  =================
            Definition:   A statistical method used to examine the relationship between two or more variables.
            Examples:   Simple Regression, Multiple Regression.
          2.4) Correlation:
	  =================
            Definition:   A measure of the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.
            Examples:   Pearson Correlation, Spearman Rank Correlation.
          2.5) ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) & Chi Square:
	  ===============================================
            Definition:   Statistical tests used to compare means across multiple groups (ANOVA) or to examine 
	    relationships between categorical variables (Chi Square).

      Mean:  
      =======
    Definition:   The average of a set of numbers.
    Types:  
      1) Arithmetic Mean:   The sum of all values divided by the number of values.
			    = AM = (sum of quantaties) / (Number of quantaties)
			    
      2) Geometric Mean:    The nth root of the product of n values, often used for growth rates.
      3) Harmonic Mean:     The reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the values, useful for 
                            rates.
			    = (Number of quantaties) / (1/a1 + 1/a2  + 1/an...)
      4) Weighted Mean:     The mean where some values contribute more than others according to their assigned 
                            weights.
